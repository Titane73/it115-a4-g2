                The Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, United States. Considered to be an icon
                of
                the city and the Pacific Northwest, it has been designated a Seattle landmark. Located in the Lower
                Queen
                Anne
                neighborhood, it was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2.3 million
                visitors. Nearly 20,000 people a day used its elevators during the event.
